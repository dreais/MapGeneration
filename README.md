# MapGeneration
Contains map generation and path finding

## What is it for? Why in C?

I'm currently working on a roguelike game, called Fed in the Abyss, and I need a powerful pathfinding/map generation algorithm using the game's language (which is C).
As for 'why in C' regarding the game - no particular reason, I'm using ncurses on top of that, so it made it easier I guess!
